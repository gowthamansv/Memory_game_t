# Memory Game

## Description
Developed a Memory Game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. This game is created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript (DOM manipulation) for game logic.


## How to Play
1. Click on a card to flip it and reveal the front face.
2. Flip another card to try and find the matching pair.
3. If the two cards match, they will remain face-up.
4. If they do not match, they will flip back after a short delay.
5. Use the "Restart Game" button to reset and shuffle the cards.
